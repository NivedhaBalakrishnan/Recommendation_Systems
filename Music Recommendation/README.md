Movie Recommendation Systems

<b>Project objective</b>: Create a music recommendation system using the Million Song Dataset's Taste profile dataset.
<b>Dataset details</b>: Includes real user-song-play count triplets, artist and song metadata (artist name, title, artist hotness, release year, duration, etc.).
<b>Project tasks</b>:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering
- Building and evaluating recommendation algorithms:
- Neural Collaborative Filtering
- Hybrid recommender system using autoencoders
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with neural network-based approach
- Incorporating additional metadata (artist and song info) to improve recommendations

Utilization of lyrics data for insights and training a neural network model to predict artist familiarity based on song metadata (hotness, duration, release year).

Evaluation of model performance using standard metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
